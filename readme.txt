Simulates the Martingale betting system - an old favourite of online scams. 

Makes 10 bets per second, and ends when you run out of money. Asumes perfect 50:50 odds of winning.


The Martingale method involves placing a small fixed bet every round, but doubling the bet on every loss, so that when the player (theoretically inevitably) next wins, the win makes up for all previous losses. The obvious problem with this strategy is that it requires something that doesn't exist - infinite wealth. In reality, all it does is weigh a high probabilty of small gains against a low probability of sudden catastrophic loss. 

However, while this system offers a gambler no advantage over random guessing, it does provide a great demonstation of the power of exponential growth and perhaps the nature of intuition.
